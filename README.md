# 1stWebProject
My first web development project using JS, HTML and CSS

Hi, this is my first project of WEB developing and I'm just praticing.
It consists in a page that shows the hour automaticly and switch the image and the background-color as the time passes during the day.

If you want to see it working in other moments of the day:
Just change the variable "h" at line 30 of script.js file

changing this  var h = time.getHours();  --> to this  var h = put the time you want //time.getHours();
